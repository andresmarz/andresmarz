# 🧑‍💻 Andres Marquez – .NET & Blazor Developer Portfolio

# 🧠 Software Development Portfolio

Welcome to my software development portfolio! I’m a passionate and detail-oriented developer focused on building clean, maintainable, and scalable applications using modern technologies — primarily within the **.NET ecosystem**.

This repository contains links and summaries of my main full-stack projects, developed with **C#**, **ASP.NET Core**, **Clean Architecture**, **Web APIs**, and **Blazor WebAssembly**, among others.

### 3. Microservices.CleanArchitecture.RestCommunication
> A real-world microservices architecture using Clean Architecture and HTTP communication via HttpClient.

- **Tech Stack:** ASP.NET Core 8, Entity Framework Core, SQL Server

- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture applied to each microservice

- **Microservices:**

  - Catalog Service: Product management with full CRUD

  - Ordering Service: Order management with full CRUD and external product validation via REST

- **Highlights:**

  - Functional and independent CRUD in each microservice

  - HTTP-based communication between services using HttpClient

  - Clear separation of internal logic and external service contracts (DTOs/External)

  - Strong adherence to Clean Architecture principles

- **Future Enhancements:**

  - Asynchronous communication (e.g., messaging via RabbitMQ)

  - Containerization with Docker

  - Unit testing with xUnit

  - Service orchestration with Kubernetes

## 🔧 In Progress / Coming Soon

I'm actively working on more advanced and realistic enterprise-level solutions, including:

- 🐳 Containerization with **Docker** and orchestration via **Kubernetes**
- ⏳ Asynchronous communication using **Messaging/Brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka)**
- Projects with AI
- 🔍 Unit and integration testing with **xUnit**
- 🎨 Frontend integration with **Blazor WebAssembly** and possibly other SPA frameworks like Angular and React
- 📄 Advanced features like:
  - Export to Excel/PDF
  - Complex filtering and pagination
  - Rich reporting capabilities
  - Secure API Gateway & Authentication strategies

All upcoming projects will be uploaded progressively as development continues.
